# MarcoTracker

A simple music tracker just for me.

Goals:

* **Just for me** - This tracker is just for me. I don't care about the wishes of others.
* **Simple** - As simple as possible while still having all features I need.
* **Fast Song Sketching** - It should be very simple and fast to sketch a song.
* **No distractions**
* **Integrated simple Synthesizer** - Should have at least the capabilities of an C64 SID.
* **Default Instruments** - Based on the synth.
* **Native Linux & Webbrowser** - Runs natively on Linux and in a Webbrowser. 
* **Small** - The complete programm should fit on a 880 KB Amiga floppy disc.
* **No Plugins** - Everytime I tried to use a modern music software, 
  I have spent hours to find the right plugins, but rarely wrote a complete song. 
* **No modular synth/routing/signals** - Everytime I tried to use a modular synth,
  I have spent hours to connect signals, but rarely wrote a complete song.  
* **Usable for 32KB demos/games**
